# Individual Project No. 2: Road Traffic Accidents

## 🌐 Introduction

**Welcome to the Road Traffic Accident Data Analysis Project in Buenos Aires**. This project aims to address one of the most critical concerns of road safety in the City of Buenos Aires. I am Lucero, the leader of this project, committed to using data analysis to improve road safety and reduce traffic incidents in our city.

## 🚦 Problem Description

Road traffic accidents, commonly known as traffic accidents, represent a significant challenge in the City of Buenos Aires. Attributable to multiple causes such as collisions, run-overs, and crashes, these incidents not only cause material damage but also severe human consequences. In Argentina, these accidents are the leading cause of violent deaths, with alarming statistics reflecting the magnitude of the problem.

## 🔍 Context

In an urban setting like Buenos Aires, with its high population density and volume of traffic, road accidents take on a critical dimension. The City, with a population of over 3 million, faces unique challenges in terms of road safety and traffic management.

## 📊 Data and Role to Be Developed

The Mobility and Road Safety Observatory (OMSV) has entrusted me to lead a comprehensive analysis of road traffic accident data, using a detailed dataset of homicides in road incidents in CABA during 2016-2021. This analysis seeks not only to identify patterns and trends but also to provide solid foundations for effective prevention policies.

## 👩‍💻 Work Proposal

The project will include:

- **ETL** (Extract, Transform and Load): Data processing to ensure a clean and complete database.
- **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis): Detailed analysis to characterize the victims and discover patterns.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A tool to explore and interpret the data, supporting decision-making.
- **KPI Definition**: Focused on reducing mortality rates and accidents.

## 📚 Data Source

We will use the "Homicides" dataset from Buenos Aires Data, which includes detailed information about road traffic accidents in the City.
